# DNA Visualization in Rust

This is a Rust reimplementation of the "DNA Visualization" project from Al Sweigart's *The Big Book of Small Python Projects*. It displays an ASCII animation of a DNA double helix with randomly generated nucleotide pairs. Original Python project [here](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/project21.html).
